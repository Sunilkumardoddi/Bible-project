    <h1 style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;text-align: center;">This is the first page about Bible</h1>
    <p>Here We have first question about bible,</p>
    <h2 style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;">What is Bible?</h2>
    <p>The Bible is the account of God’s action in the world, and his purpose with all creation. The writing of the
        Bible took place over sixteen centuries and is the work of over forty human authors. It is quite an amazing
        collection of 66 books with very different styles, all containing the message God desired us to have.

        This compilation of booklets contains an astonishing variety of literary styles. It provides many stories about
        the lives of good and bad people, about battles and journeys, about the life of Jesus, and about early church
        activity. It comes to us in narratives and dialogues, in proverbs and parables, in songs and allegories, in
        history and prophecy.
        The accounts in the Bible were not generally written down as they occurred. Rather they were told over and over
        again and handed down through the years, before eventually being written down. Yet the same themes may be found
        throughout the book. Along with the diversity, there is also remarkable unity throughout.</p>
    <p>So what is the Bible? Well, in addition to all the above, the Bible is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A guide for living life to the full. It gives us a road map for the perilous journey of life. Or to put it
            another way, on our voyage through life’s ocean, the Bible is an anchor.</li>
        <li>A storehouse of wonderful stories for children and grownups. Remember Noah and the ark? Joseph’s coat of
            many colors? Daniel in the lion’s den? Jonah and the fish? The parables of Jesus? These stories emphasize
            the triumphs and failures of ordinary people.</li>
        <li>A refuge in trouble. People in pain, in suffering, in prison, and in mourning tell how turning to the Bible
            brought strength in their desperate hour.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;">How to read bible.?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;">Ask God for Directions!</li>
        <p>If you are lost and need direction you would likely stop and ask someone familiar with that area to help
            orient and direct you. Well, let’s face it, nobody knows the Word better than the Author Himself. Before you
            open your bible, begin with a simple prayer asking God to take the wheel and direct your time in His word to
            reap the greatest blessing and for His glory. When you pray simply quiet your mind as much as you can and
            begin to notice the whispers and small voices you sense. Many times when I begin my study time like this
            I’ll hear the Lord speak a book of the Bible, or the name of a person in His word. Other times it’s quiet.
            If that’s the case, don’t worry, when you invite the Holy Spirit to direct your time in the Word, you can
            rest assured it is in competent hands and nothing you read, study or pray will ever be meaningless or
            without purpose. God’s Word NEVER returns void and it will always accomplish His purposes. So, even if you
            don’t understand the reason for what you read in the moment, many times you will experience an “ah-ha”
            moment later that day, week or months down the road that help you recognize Him at work in your life! When I
            begin my bible time, I pray this simple prayer:

            Lord Jesus, Father God, Holy Spirit I thank you that you have given me a guide book – a map – for how to do
            life through your Word. I thank you that it is alive and vibrant and timely. I thank you that through it you
            speak directly into my life, provide wisdom, inspire change, and refresh my soul. Lord, as I open your Word
            today I do so expectantly and with gratitude. I ask you now to take the wheel and direct this time spent
            with you. Will you help me to hear you and will you guide and direct me to exactly the words and messages I
            need to hear from you today that will produce the greatest blessings for me and those around me, and bring
            you the most glory. I thank you in advance for revealing yourself to me through your Word. In Jesus name I
            pray, amen.

            Consider struggles, celebrations and prayers!

            The next thing I do before I spend time in God’s Word is to take a moment to ask Him to bring to mind
            anything I’ve been struggling with, praying about, or even praising Him for. By doing this I’m making my
            mind aware and alert to notice any messages He may offer me through His word. Many, many times after I do
            this I turn directly to a passage that literally jumps off the page at me because it directly addresses the
            struggle, prayers and celebrations the Lord just helped bring to the front of my thoughts. It’s a wonderful
            way to be personally minister to by, and through, God’s Word.

        </p>
        <li style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;">Start with Just a Verse</li>
        <p>As I mentioned, sometimes I go into a time of study with very clear direction from the Lord. I know that I
            know that He’s directed me there. Other times though, it’s not as clear. I don’t necessarily always feel
            super led by the Lord as I read His Word and that’s OK! If that’s where you’re at, don’t let that discourage
            you. It takes practice to learn to hear God and you can rest assured that as long as your reading His Word,
            you are being blessed and planting seeds that will reap a good harvest. Just try to relax and enjoy that
            time. On the days when I don’t feel like I’ve got clear direction I will simply look up the daily verse on a
            bible app (I love Biblegateway.com but there are many options available out there!) and turn to that verse
            in my bible. I’ll tell you something, it’s a great way to study because so often it forces me into places in
            God’s Word I’m not as necessarily inclined to visit and study. It’s a great place to get started!</p>
        <li style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;">Use a Devotional</li>
        <p>Devotional books are another great tool that I use to help guide my time in God’s Word. There are literally
            thousands of amazing, divinely inspired daily devotionals you can get your hands on. There are daily
            devotional apps and of course good old fashioned devotional books. Devotionals are a wonderful tool for a
            couple of reasons. First, they help guide you to a specific scripture to focus on, and second, they help
            provide thoughtful application for that scripture. Should you choose to use devotionals to help guide your
            time with the Lord, I would offer one bit of encouragement though – only use them as a guide TO scripture,
            not as a replacement for scripture. I can’t tell you how easy it is to find yourself with an open devotional
            book and a closed bible. Yes, the devotional contains scripture, but friends, there is simply no substitute
            for the Word of God itself. I can’t encourage you enough on this. If you use a devotional allow it to guide
            you to a scripture, but read it out of the Bible itself. There are so many times the Lord has led me
            somewhere in His Word through a one or two verse devotional but I’ve ended up reading an entire chapter that
            blessed me, or I got a clear message from Him through the verse before or after those the devotional focused
            on. Trust me on this one, you’ll be so glad for it!</p>
        <li style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;">Chunk it Up!</li>
        <p>When my son was learning to read, his teacher taught him to “chunk up” the word. Rather than trying to
            decipher a long, confounding word like “important”, she taught him to take it in chunks - “im” “por” “tant”.
            Then, take each chunk and link it back together in a way that made sense. When we’d read together, if he
            struggled with a word, I’d remind him, “Just chunk it up.”

            Several years later, I was studying God’s word and realized the same method is incredibly helpful in
            understanding the Bible. One of the most frequent comments I hear from people when I coach them spiritually
            is that they are overwhelmed and don’t know where to start studying God’s word. Or, that they get
            sidetracked or bored when they’re reading the Bible. The solution to both of these obstacles is also the
            solution to understanding the Bible in a way that helps you apply it. Simply use the “chunk it up” method.
            Rather than setting out to read passage after passage simply for the sake of reading the Bible front to
            back, try reading it in very small bits and pieces. Pray and ask the Holy Spirit to lead you and then choose
            a single verse or two. Read it, then read it again. Read it in several translations. Read each single word
            individually. Look up and research each word. The key to loving time in God’s word comes when we dig deep in
            an effort to understand it. It becomes fun, like a treasure hunt! As the Lord brings illumination to words
            and begins to draw connections and word pictures, it’s like a puzzle coming together right before your very
            eyes. Studying the Word this way will help you understand how truly alive, powerful and timely God’s Word
            is. Read, study and love the Word of God. It’s fun, try it!</p>

    <h3 style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;">Know we should know about <em>Jesus</em> christ.</h3>
    <h4 style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;"><strong>Who Was <mark>Jesus</mark> Christ?</strong></h4>
    <p>Jesus Christ was born circa 6 B.C. in Bethlehem. Little is known about his early life, but his life and his
        ministry are recorded in the New Testament, more a theological document than a biography. According to
        Christians, Jesus is considered the incarnation of God and his teachings are followed as an example for living a
        more spiritual life. Christians believe he died for the sins of all people and rose from the dead.</p>

    <h4 style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;"><strong>Background and Early Life</strong></h4>
    <p>Most of Jesus' life is told through the four Gospels of the New Testament Bible, known as the Canonical gospels,
        written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. These are not biographies in the modern sense but accounts with
        allegorical intent. They are written to engender faith in Jesus as the Messiah and the incarnation of God, who
        came to teach, suffer and die for people’s sins.

        Jesus was born circa 6 B.C. in Bethlehem. His mother, Mary, was a virgin who was betrothed to Joseph, a
        carpenter. Christians believe Jesus was born through Immaculate Conception. His lineage can be traced back to
        the house of David. According to the Gospel of Matthew (2:1), Jesus was born during the reign of Herod the
        Great, who upon hearing of his birth felt threatened and tried to kill Jesus by ordering all of Bethlehem’s male
        children under age two to be killed. But Joseph was warned by an angel and took Mary and the child to Egypt
        until Herod’s death, where upon he brought the family back and settled in the town of Nazareth, in Galilee.</p>

        Unfold! Unfold! Take in His light,
        Who makes thy cares more short than night.
        The joys which with His day-star rise
        He deals to all but drowsy eyes;

        And, what the men of this world miss
        Some drops and dews of future bliss.
        Hark! How His winds have changd their note!
        And with warm whispers call thee out;

        The frosts are past, the storms are gone,
        And backward life at last comes on.
        The lofty groves in express joys
        Reply unto the turtles voice;

        And here in dust and dirt, O here
        The lilies of His love appear!</q>

    <h4 style="color: brown;font-family: verdana;font-weight: bold;">Jesus' Ministry:</h4>
    <p style="color:rgb(211, 129, 114);">Jesus returned to Galilee and made trips to neighboring villages. During this
        time, several
        people became his
        disciples. One of these was Mary Magdalene, who is first mentioned the Gospel of Luke (16:9) and later in all
        four gospels at the crucifixion. Though not mentioned in the context of the " 12 disciples," she is considered
        to have been involved in Jesus's ministry from the beginning to his death and after. According to the gospels of
        Mark and John, Jesus appeared to Magdalene first after his resurrection.</p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">According to the Gospel of John (2:1-11), as Jesus was beginning his ministry, he and
        his disciples traveled with
        his mother, Mary, to a wedding at Cana in Galilee. The wedding host had run out of wine and Jesus's mother came
        to him for help. At first, Jesus refused to intervene, but then he relented and asked a servant to bring him
        large jars filled with water. He turned the water into a wine of higher quality than any served during the
        wedding. John's gospel depicts the event as the first sign of Jesus's glory and his disciples' belief in him.
    </p>

    <p style="color:Tomato;">After the wedding, Jesus, his mother Mary and his disciples traveled to Jerusalem for
        Passover. At the temple,
        they saw moneychangers and merchants selling wares. In a rare display of anger, Jesus overturned the tables and,
        with a whip made of cords, drove them out, declaring that his Father’s house is not a house for merchants.</p>
    <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
        The Synoptic Gospels chronicle Jesus as he traveled through Judea and Galilee, using parables and miracles to
        explain how the prophecies were being fulfilled and that the kingdom of God was near. As word spread of Jesus's
        teaching and healing the sick and diseased, more people began to follow him. At one point, Jesus came to a level
        area and was joined by a great number of people. There, at the Sermon on the Mount, he presented several
        discourses, known as the Beatitudes, which encapsulate many of the spiritual teachings of love, humility and
        compassion.
    </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">
        As Jesus continued preaching about the kingdom of God, the crowds grew larger and began to proclaim him as the
        son of David and as the Messiah. The Pharisees heard of this and publicly challenged Jesus, accusing him of
        having the power of Satan. He defended his actions with a parable, then questioned their logic and told them
        such thinking denied the power of God, which only further hardened their resolve to work against him.
